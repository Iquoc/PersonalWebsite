			<h1>ART 224</h1>

			<p class="tab">
					In my first year of university, I was able to take part in a digital photography class, ART 224.  The class explored the basics in camera mechanics such as shutter speed, ISO, and aperture.  
				Additionally, our professor included exercises that helped develop skills in depth of field, exposure, composition, color, lighting, and storytelling.
